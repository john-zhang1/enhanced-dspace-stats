# üìä Enhanced DSpace Statistics

Improved and extended statistics for DSpace 7.6, tailored to the needs of administrators, researchers, and stakeholders.

---

## Why Change? ‚Äî Problem Statement

The default statistics pages in **DSpace 7** are limited in scope and usability:

- The tatistics pages offer data across different scopes, including site, community, collection, and individual items. However, their limited scope and plain text presentation reduce usability and effectiveness, failing to meet the diverse needs of administrators, researchers, and stakeholders.
- Community and Collection statistics pages offer only views of their home pages instead of stats of all items in community/collection.
- Lack of meaningful visualizations, filtering, and deeper insights.

This repository enhances the **Site**, **Community**, **Collection**, and **Item** statistics pages by introducing richer, more actionable data.

- Total number of **pageviews** and **downloads** (all items)
- Monthly **pageviews/downloads** (last 6 months)
- Pageviews/downloads **by country**
- Pageviews/downloads **by city**
- **Top 10 most viewed/downloaded items**

### Item
- Total number of **pageviews** and **downloads**
- Monthly **pageviews/downloads** (last 6 months)

These enhancements allow stakeholders to track usage trends, discover geographic interest, and analyze item growth over time.
